# Curve Solver

Advanced curve fitting tool built with **Vue 3**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. Supports multiple equation types including linear, quadratic, cubic, circle, and ellipse regression.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Vue 3** with Composition API
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Vite** for lightning-fast development
- **pnpm** for efficient package management
- **mathjs** for mathematical computations

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Type checking
pnpm type-check

# Format code
pnpm format
```

## 📊 Features

- **Tab-based interface** for different equation types
- **Real-time curve fitting** with mathematical accuracy
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop
- **TypeScript support** throughout the codebase
- **Modern Vue 3 patterns** with Composition API

## 🧮 Supported Equations

- Linear: `y = ax + b`
- Quadratic: `y = ax² + bx + c`
- Cubic: `y = ax³ + bx² + cx + d`
- Circle: `(x-h)² + (y-k)² = r²`
- Ellipse: `(x-h)²/a² + (y-k)²/b² = 1`

Each equation type provides detailed coefficients and R² values for regression quality assessment.
